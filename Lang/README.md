Lang is a project that i made to be an alternative to programs like Memrise and Quizlet. with a simple and customizable user interface and focus on verbs, it is good for studying. 

Lang is completely **free** and features **no ads**.

Potentially Upcoming Features:

These are some features that have been suggested for Lang. None of these are guaranteed to come, and not all are in development at the current time for one reason or another. However, I think that all of these have merit and am considering them to be added in the future. 

If you want to suggest one, go to Github Issues page and use the "Suggestion" tag.
