# To get your Studysheet featured, you must do a few things.
## To begin, make 100% sure that there are NO errors in the sheet. 
Make sure that every conjugation is spelled correctly, including accent marks. 
Make sure that no conjugations are mixed up- the me,you,he/she,them,etc conjugations are in the correct places.
Make sure that the sheet is readable- if your PC had an error and corrupted the Studysheet, it cannot be featured. Please test it before sending.

## Sending in the Studysheet

### begin by writing an email to nwvbug@gmail.com
The subject should be: 

"Lang Studysheet: [language: subject], requesting to be featured"

For example,

"Lang Studysheet: French: French 2 Passe Compose√© Verbs, requesting to be featured"

Next, the body of the email should include a short description of the Studysheet (does it include verbs from a specific lesson of a French textbook? if so, name the textbook. Does it include vocabulary as well as verbs? Specify that as well.)

Finally, attach the Studysheet .txt file.


## When will it be approved?

The NWVBUG Lang team will review your Studysheet in the coming days. Please be patient as you wait. If it is confirmed to be correct, the information included in the email is adequate, and the team feels that the community will benefit from it being featured, it will be posted. 

We reserve the right to deny any Studysheet from being featured for any reason. 

You will NOT be notified if your Studysheet is accepted or denied. If you want to know if it is posted, Watch <a href='https://github.com/nwvbug/nwvbug/'> this</a> GitHub repository.
